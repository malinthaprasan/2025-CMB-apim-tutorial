6. Click **Create**.

## Step 4: MCP Server development and testing
The MCP Servers created in Step 2 and Step 3 are now ready for development and testing.
The following steps should be performed for both MCP Servers to complete their development and testing process.

### Step 4.1: Navigate to the Policy section under the Develop menu
1. Click on the **Policies** tab.
2. Verify how the actual backend rest API is being mapped with MCP Server tools.


### Step 4.2: Navigate to the MCP Playground under the Test menu
1. Click on the **MCP Playground** tab. 
2. Select Development from the environment drop-down list (If you have deployed the API to other environments, you can select the respective options as well). 
3. Click on Get Test Key if the test key is not populated 
4. Click on Connect to connect with your deployed MCP Server. 
5. You can select and call individual tools by providing the parameters if necessary.Tool calling via the MCP Playground is currently not supported for MCP Servers created from existing APIs.
Hence this will not be worked for `Notification MCP`.

### Step 4.3: Promote the MCP server to the Production

1. Navigate to **Deploy**
2. In the Development card, click Promote.
3. In the Configuration Types pane, select the option Use Development endpoint configuration and click Next.
4. The Production card indicates the Deployment Status as Active when the MCP Server is successfully deployed to production.

### Step 4.4: Publish the MCP Server
1. Navigate to **Lifecycle**.
2. Click on the **Publish** button to publish the MCP Server.
3. The MCP Server is now published and available for use in the Developer Portal.

### Step 4.5: Navigate to devportal

### Step 4.6: Go to the MCP Server listing page using the left navigation menu and select your MCP Server
1. Discover the available tools under MCP landing page
2. Copy the configuration for setting up the MCP Server with an MCP Client.

### Step 4.7: Subscribe to the MCP Server and generate token
1. Create or select an application from the Developer Portal.
2. Subscribe to the MCP Server through that application.
3. generate a valid OAuth2 token. (refer to the "Generate Keys" section in the Developer Portal)

**The Notification MCP Server has been created using an existing API Proxy, you need to subscribe to both `Notification API` Proxy and `Notification MCP` using the same application.
Make sure to copy the token as you will need it in the next step.**

## Step 5: Configure MCP Client
1. Open VS Code with the Copilot Agent extension.
2. Copy the MCP Server Configuration from the overview tab for both `Notification MCP` and `Card Promotions MCP`.
3. Add them as a new server configuration in mcp.json within your VS Code environment. 
4. Replace the token placeholder with the token you generated in Step 7.

### Step 5.1: Connect and Interact
1. Start the servers via VS Code.
2. If everything is configured correctly, the client will:
   - Connect to the MCP Servers.
   - Automatically discover and list the available MCP Tools in both MCP servers.

### Step 5.2: Use the Tools
Open the chat option in Copilot to start trying out the MCP tools!
